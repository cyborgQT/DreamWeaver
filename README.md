A vertical slice of a children's game about forming dreams. Enter to advance dialogue, arrow keys to move the cursor, space to select items, r to restart. Pick the three items hinted at by the clue in the dialogue.  

for the good ending, you need to have 3 good dreams, otherwise you get the bad ending. The good ending has two sheep sleeping. The bad has one crying. 

Audrey did the art, Kathryn, Leslyanne, and Julia all did the code.
